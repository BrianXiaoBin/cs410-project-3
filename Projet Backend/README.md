Distance.p is a main file for the programm. Enjoy your holidays. 

I uncluded whole folder because I used some of the functions from the pico files and settings.json

You can also see a picture of the pico set up. I used 2 resistors, 2.2k and 3.3k to have a stable current. I used ultrasonic sensor and a RGB LED to show the warning signals of the close object.
