# Project Title
This is a Robot sensor implemented software project for atsign. This project was a part of Software Engineering Course CS410 for Fall 2022.




## About the device

The robot sensor device detects distance from the obstacles if any. It then displays this distance at a continous rate on the flutter app that we made for this project. 
The device also has an LED light that blinks and notifies the user if an obstacle is present.

## Code language

This entire project was implemeted in Python language. We use visual studio code as the environment to run the tests. 

## Running Tests

To run tests, the visual studio code environment can be used. The atsigns from both the device itself and the project code are connected and let the data tranfer to be easy. While running the code the computer can be connected to either use the chrome app to display the flutter app or even a mobile device. 





## Demo

The demo of this project was given to atsign during the final demo days.
